# AI Chatbot (Ollama) - Not Working After Deployment 🚫  

## ❌ Issue  
This project is **not working after deployment** because it relies on **Ollama**, which was running **locally** on my system. Since Ollama is not accessible on a remote server, the chatbot fails to generate responses.  

## 🔧 Possible Solutions  
If you want to make this chatbot work online, you can:  
1. **Use a Cloud-Based AI API** (e.g., DeepSeek API, OpenAI, or Cohere).  
2. **Host Ollama on a Cloud Server** (but this requires a VPS like AWS or DigitalOcean).  

## ✅ Recommended Fix  
Replace the Ollama API request with a cloud-based AI API like **DeepSeek**, which is free and easy to use.
